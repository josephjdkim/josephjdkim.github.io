LoD is a data-driven tool for determining ideal Champion (playable character) combinations in League of Legends, an internationally popular online tean game. The app uses Riot's own API to collect data on top-performing players' match histories. Using statistics from team compositions of those games, we determine which Champion combinations have the highest winrates."
