		<h2>Hello, world.</h2>
		<p>My name is Joseph Jungdo Kim. I'm a second-year undergraduate student at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and am expecting to graduate in Spring 2020. Though I'm not currently specializing in a field of CS right now, I am developing interest in machine learning and cybersecurity.</p>
		<p>More than just a computer science student, I see myself as an artist, musician, dreamer, lame-comedian, brother and son, and human. I'm excited to see how my creativity and identity will guide me as a computer scientist to produce things that aren't just good, but great. I've lived my entire life trying to grasp the things that have interested me. I've never seen it as spreading myself too thin or having eyes too big; if something is interesting, it means I find some sort of real value in it. And because of that, I want to offer what I can to it - I want to understand it, I want to excel in it, I want to share it, I want to leave my impact through it.</p>
		<p>And so, as I grow both professionally and as a person, I am excited to see what I can offer to my employers, my coworkers, my peers, and the rest of the world.</p>
